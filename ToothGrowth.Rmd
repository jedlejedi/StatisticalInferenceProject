## Summary of the Data in the ToothGrowth Dataset

The ToothGrowth dataset in R contains measures of the effect of various dose levels of Vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) on tooth growth in 60 guinea pigs. For each dose level, 2 different delivery methods are compared: orange juice (OJ) and ascorbic acid (VC).

```{r}
head(ToothGrowth)

summary(ToothGrowth)
```

A number of hypothesis can be made regarding the effect of Vitamin C on tooth gowth.

Higher dose levels of Vitamin C seem to yield to greater tooth gowth.
That seems to be the cases regardless of the delivery method.

```{r warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = ToothGrowth, aes(dose, len, color = supp)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + xlab("Dose in milligrams/day") + ylab("Tooth length") + theme(legend.title=element_blank()) + ggtitle("Impact of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth")
```

Orange juice seems to be a more efficient delivery method than ascorbic acid for dose levels of 0.5 and 1 mg/day. 
For 2mg/day, it is not clear whether the delivery method makes a difference.

```{r}
ggplot(data = ToothGrowth, aes(x=factor(dose), y=len, fill=supp)) + geom_boxplot() + xlab("Dose in milligrams/day") + ylab("Tooth length") + theme(legend.title=element_blank()) + ggtitle("Impact Vitmanin C Delivery Method on Tooth Growth")
```

## Hypothesis Testing

### Impact of Dose Levels on Tooth Growth

```{r}
tg05 <- subset(ToothGrowth, dose == 0.5) 
tg1 <- subset(ToothGrowth, dose == 1)
tg2 <- subset(ToothGrowth, dose == 2)
```

### 0.5 vs 1 mg/day

Null Hypothesis: Increasing Dosage from 0.5mg to 1mg does not yield to greater tooth gowth

```{r}
t.test(tg1$len, tg05$len, paired = FALSE, var.equal = FALSE, alternative = "greater", conf.level = 0.975)$conf
```
The confidence interval is above 0 we therefore reject the null hypothesis. Increasing the dose level from 0.5 to 1 mg/a day yields to greater tooth growth.

### 1 vs 2 mg/day

Null Hypothesis: Increasing Dosage from 1mg to 2mg does not yield to greater tooth gowth

```{r}
t.test(tg2$len, tg1$len, paired = FALSE, var.equal = FALSE, alternative = "greater", conf.level = 0.975)$conf
```
The confidence interval is above 0 we therefore reject the null hypothesis.
Increasing the dose level from 1 to 2 mg/a day yields to greater tooth growth.

### Impact of Delivery Methods on Tooth Growth

```{r}
tgOJ <- subset(ToothGrowth, supp == "OJ") 
tgVC <- subset(ToothGrowth, supp == "VC")
```

Null Hypothesis: The delivery method has no impact on tooth growth

```{r}
t.test(tgOJ$len, tgVC$len, paired = FALSE, var.equal = FALSE)$conf
```
The 95% confidence interval contains 0. We therefore cannot reject the null hypothesis. We cannot conclude that the delivery method has an impact on tooth growth.

### Impact of Delivery Methods on Tooth Growth for Various Dose Levels

#### Dosage = 0.5mg/day

Null Hypothesis: For a dosage of 0.5mg/day, the delivery method has no impact on tooth growth

```{r}
tgOJ05 <- subset(tgOJ, dose == 0.5) 
tgVC05 <- subset(tgVC, dose == 0.5)

t.test(tgOJ05$len, tgVC05$len, paired = FALSE, var.equal = FALSE)$conf
```
The 95% confidence interval does not contain 0. We therefore reject the null hypothesis. For a dose of 0.5 mg/day, using Orange jucice as delivery method seems to have a positive impact on tooth growth.


#### Dosage = 1mg/day

Null Hypothesis: For a dosage of 1mg/day, the delivery method has no impact on tooth growth

```{r}
tgOJ1 <- subset(tgOJ, dose == 1) 
tgVC1 <- subset(tgVC, dose == 1)

t.test(tgOJ1$len, tgVC1$len, paired = FALSE, var.equal = FALSE)$conf
```
The 95% confidence interval does not contain 0. We therefore reject the null hypothesis. For a dose of 1 mg/day, using Orange jucice as delivery method seems to have a positive impact on tooth growth.

#### Dosage = 2mg/day

Null Hypothesis: For a dosage of 2mg/day, the delivery method has no impact on tooth growth

```{r}
tgOJ2 <- subset(tgOJ, dose == 2) 
tgVC2 <- subset(tgVC, dose == 2)

t.test(tgOJ2$len, tgVC2$len, paired = FALSE, var.equal = FALSE)$conf
```
The 95% confidence interval contains 0. We therefore fail to reject the null hypothesis. For a dose of 2 mg/day, we cannot conclude that the delivery method has an impact on tooth growth.

## Conclusions

Based on our analysis of the data in the ToothGrowth dataset we can conclude the following:

* Higher dose levels of Vitamin C yield to greater tooth gowth.
* Orange juice a more efficient delivery method than ascorbic acid for dose levels of 0.5mg/day and 1mg/day
* The delivery method does not seem to impact tooth gowth for dose levels of 2 mg/day


## Assumptions

One of the key assumptions made in this study is that the variances between different dose levels and delivery methods are not equal.
